Features that I have included :

Basic features :

	1)Modified the bubble movement to incorporate vertical motion such that the bubbles travel in a
	  parabolic path. When the balls hits the horizontal ground,  They bounce off the ground.
	2)Introduced collision between the bubble and the bullet; the bubble and the corresponding
	  butllet disappears after a bullet hits it.
	3)Introduced collision between the bubble and the shooter; the shooter looses 1 Health Point
	  if a bubble touches it.

Extra features :

	1)Used bubbles of different sizes. When a bullet hits the larger bubbles the bubbles split into
	  smaller bubbles (half the radius of the original larger bubble) and move in horizontally
	  opposite directions.
	2)Added a score, time and a health counter. The score increases by 100 points whenever we hit a
	  bubble. The game gets over when we run out of time(50s) (measured in seconds) or if we run out
	  of health (whenever the bubble hits the shooter, the health reduces by 1).
	3)Implemented different levels of the game. Once we destroy all the bubbles in one level,
	  we move to the next level which is difficult in terms of more bubbles. The bubbles in
	  different levels have different colors.
	4)The shooter changes it's color to red whenever any bubble touches the shooter and returns
	  to green color when no bubble is touching the shooter.
	5)I have implemented a power up which I call as the "Death's Barrage", this power up shoots
	  3 bullets with a separation of 15 pixel unit between them whenever we hit the spacebar key.
	  using this power up costs 400 of your score points(i.e you can only use it whenever you have
	  score points greater than or equal to 400).
